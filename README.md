###### GPT is interesting, let's use it to create a better world.

This README.md file will guide you through the process of integrating the GPT API into your PHP-based website, enabling chat functionality using OpenAI's API.


## Prerequisites
-  PHP 7.4 or higher installed on your web server
-  A web server with support for PHP (e.g., Apache or Nginx)
-  Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for designing the chat interface)
-  An API key for the GPT API from Openai.com

## API Key
- Register for an account or log in to the OpenAi platform.
- Navigate to the API Keys section and generate a new API key.
- Store the API key safely, as you will need it in the next step.

## Setting Up
- Clone or download this repository.
- Replace YOUR_API_KEY and MODEL in config.php.
- Replace the API_ENDPOINT URL in gptchat.php according to your needs (see list below).
- Upload index.html, style.css, script.js, and gptchat.php files to your web server.
- Access index.html in your browser (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/index.html).
- Type a message in the chat input field and press Enter or click the Send button to send the message.
- The OpenAI API should respond with a message from the language model.
- Be cautious and set limits on your OpenAI Dashboard.
